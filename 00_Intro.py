# Databricks notebook source
# MAGIC %md The purpose of this notebook is to set the various configuration values that will control the notebooks that make up the QA Bot accelerator.  This notebook is available at https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/diy-llm-qa-bot.

# MAGIC %md ##Introduction
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The goal of this solution accelerator is to show how we can leverage a large language model in combination with our own data to create an interactive application capable of answering questions specific to a particular domain or subject area.  The core pattern behind this is the delivery of a question along with a document or document fragment that provides relevant context for answering that question to the model.  The model will then respond with an answer that takes into consideration both the question and the context.

# MAGIC To aseemble this application, *i.e.* the Q&A Bot, we will need to assemble a series of documents that are relevant to the domain we wish to serve.  We will need to index these to enable rapid search given a user question. We will then need to assemble the core application which combines a question with a document to form a prompt and submits that prompt to a model in order to generate a response. Finally, we'll need to package both the indexed documents and the core application component as a microservice to enable a wide range of deployment options.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will tackle these three steps across the following three notebooks:</p>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * 01: Build Document Index
# MAGIC * 02: Assemble Application
# MAGIC * 03: Deploy Application
